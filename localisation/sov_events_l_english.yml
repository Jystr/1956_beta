 soviet.490.t:0 "Tukhachevsky Launches a Coup!"
 soviet.490.d:0 "Marshal Tukhachevsky has tricked a trusting Stalin, launching a military coup d'etat. Some loyal officers have rallied around Stalin but the military has almost been split in half. This war must be ended quickly, before all the progress and achievements of the Soviet people are undone."
 soviet.490.a:0 "To war it is."
 soviet.65.t:0 "Trotsky Betrays Worker's Revolution!"
 soviet.65.d:0 "The Soviet people have discovered that Trotsky has signed a tacit diplomatic alliance with the fascist empire of Germany. Understandably, they are outraged that the worker's revolution has been put on hold to make a deal with the devil. Unrest in the Soviet Union is spreading like wild-fire."
 soviet.65.a:0 "A serious setback."
 soviet.66.t:0 "United Resistance Against Soviet Expansion"
 soviet.66.d:0 "The Soviet Union is using military force to begin marxist revolution in our country. This cannot stand. While we may not be able to stand up to the behemoth on our own, we can request assistance from our neighbors who are also concerned about the Soviet threat."
 soviet.66.a:0 "Call other free nations into the fight."
 soviet.67.t:0 "[From.GetName] Calls Free European Nations to War"
 soviet.67.d:1 "The Anti-Soviet Pact stipulates that all signatories must join in any defensive conflict with the Soviet Union.

It is time to show the [Root.GetAdjective] dedication to protecting the world from the threat of the Soviet Union once and for all."
 soviet.67.d:1 "The Soviet Union cannot be allowed to use their military might to force the spread of communism in Europe. Communism is a vile plague to the world, something that contradicts everything that we hold dear. [From.GetName] has now been attacked by the Soviets and has sent out a request for all fellow free european nations to come to their aid immediately."

 soviet.68.t:0 "Trial of Stalin"
 soviet.68.d:0 "In what has been widely considered a kangaroo court, the special panel formed to investigate the crimes of the former Soviet leader has found him guilty on all 859 counts. The panel proclaimed that Stalin's biggest crime was the criminal unpreparedness of the Red Army to enforce the spread of communism and the traitorous lack of desire to do so. Stalin was then executed by firing squad on live radio."
 soviet.68.a:0 "Disturbing."
 soviet.68.b:0 "A necessary charade."
 
 soviet.69.t:0 "The Return of Japanese-occupied China"
 soviet.69.d:0 "We will demand that Japan return lands conquered from China in previous conflicts, back to the Chinese people. Trotsky has instructed the foreign ministry to threaten war if the Japanese should reject our proposal. We will be generous and give them North Sakhalin if they accept." 
 soviet.69.a:0 "Send them an offer they cannot refuse."
 
 soviet.70.t:0 "The Soviet Union Demands that we Return Land to China"
 soviet.70.d:0 "The Soviets have demanded that we cede Mengkukuo, Manchukuo, and occupied Hebei to the People's Republic of China, else they will declare war on us. In return, they claim that they will give us North Sakhalin. This is a very poor trade, but we can ill-afford a war with the Soviets. What shall we do?" 
 soviet.70.a:0 "We will comply with their unreasonable demands."
 soviet.70.b:0 "We will try to get a better deal."
 soviet.70.c:0 "We will refuse their request."
 
 soviet.71.t:0 "Japanese Immediately cede Chinese lands"
 soviet.71.d:0 "The Japanese have chosen to comply with our demands. Troops from the People's Republic of China have already established control over Manchuria and Beijing. It is now up to us to deliver on our part of the deal." 
 soviet.71.a:0 "Very well."
 
 soviet.72.t:0 "The Japanese Refuse Us"
 soviet.72.d:0 "The Japanese have rejected our proposal and expelled our diplomats. That they would dare to do such a thing is inconcievable. Trotsky must declare war on them as he promised, else lose all credibility. Luckily for us, our diligent general staff already has an operation in progress to punish the Japanese for their insolence." 
 soviet.72.a:0 "We have prepared for this."
 
 soviet.73.t:0 "Soviet Troops Seize Hokkaido"
 soviet.73.d:0 "The Japanese high command was shocked today to hear that Soviet Paratroopers are landing in the region of Hokkaido, eliminating our garrisons there and securing the entire region for the Soviet Union. It is only a matter of time before Soviet Marines land, accompanied by Infantry and Armored Divisions. The invasion of our home islands begins!" 
 soviet.73.a:0 "Attacked before a declaration of war?!"
 
 soviet.74.t:0 "Japan Wishes to Barter"
 soviet.74.d:0 "The Japanese have informed us that they are open to ceding land back to the Chinese people, but that we must offer them something better. That we must barter with the Japanese like meiserly capitalist pigs is extremely insulting. How shall we react?" 
 soviet.74.a:0 "We will make a better offer."
 soviet.74.b:0 "We will use force."
 soviet.74.c:0 "Forget it, this is a waste of time."
 
 soviet.75.t:0 "The Soviet Union sends us a Declaration of War"
 soviet.75.d:0 "In an unexpected turn, the Soviet delegation has told us that the Soviet Union has abandoned the talks upon our 'refusal' of their ultimatum. They have delivered to us a declaration of war." 
 soviet.75.a:0 "Hostilities commense."
 
 soviet.76.t:0 "The Soviets Offer us Dockyards"
 soviet.76.d:0 "In response to our request, the Soviet Union has proposed to send us dockyard equipment so that we can construct new drydocks, disassembling their own drydock machinery in the process. It seems that they want to give us industry that we cannot use to make weapons against them. Is this deal satisfactory to us?" 
 soviet.76.a:0 "It is satisfactory."
 soviet.76.b:0 "Ask for industrial goods instead."
 
 soviet.77.t:0 "Japan Accepts Dockyards"
 soviet.77.d:0 "The Japanese have accepted our proposal to disassemble our dockyard machinery to ship to Japan in exchange for Chinese land. While this is more than we had originally intended to give up, we have completed our objective and this must be counted as a win for Trotsky and the Soviet people as a whole." 
 soviet.77.a:0 "A Fair Deal."
 
 soviet.78.t:0 "The Japanese Request Industrial Goods"
 soviet.78.d:0 "The Japanese have rejected our offer of naval dockyards and have instead proposed that we give them industrial goods instead. The Japanese claim that they understand our reluctance to provide anything that can be used against us in the future, but that these industrial goods will be used for civilian consumption." 
 soviet.78.a:0 "Very well, we accept the deal."
 soviet.78.b:0 "We think not, the Japanese are lying."
 
 soviet.79.t:0 "The Soviets Accept our Proposal"
 soviet.79.d:0 "The Soviets have agreed to give us civilian industry, at economic cost to themselves. It wasn't too bad of a deal in the end, we should be able to use this newly acquired industry to reinvigorate our own domestic arms industry." 
 soviet.79.a:0 "The best possible outcome."
 
 soviet.80.t:0 "Talks Break Down"
 soviet.80.d:0 "Not only have the Soviets rejected our proposal, but they seem to have lost interest in the affair altogether. We have just learned that the Soviet delegation has departed and our foreign ministry doubts that we will hear from them anytime soon." 
 soviet.80.a:0 "What a relief."
 
 soviet.81.t:0 "Beginning of the Lend-Lease Programme"
 soviet.81.d:0 "American aid will be invaluable to us. They will help specialize and supplement our production, and where our production is lacking. Unfortunately it will be some months before the first major shipment gets here." 
 soviet.81.a:0 "We will have to wait."
 
 soviet.82.t:0 "First Delivery"
 soviet.82.d:0 "The first allied lend-lease shipment has arrived. The sheer number of vehicles, jeeps, and various equipment is staggering. The British, surprisingly, have sent us a significant amount of aid also. The trucks we have received are doubly useful for moving supplies, but also towing our old artillery which have been sitting in our reserves." 
 soviet.82.a:0 "About time."
 
 soviet.83.t:0 "Second Delivery"
 soviet.83.d:0 "This second allied shipment has managed to surpass the last one in terms of equipment sent. The American trucks are very reliable and robust - an excellent platform for our new rocket artillery platforms. We will turn the American Studebakers into Katusha rocket launchers and strike fear very deep into the german lines." 
 soviet.83.a:0 "Excellent."
 
 soviet.84.t:0 "Third Delivery"
 soviet.84.d:0 "We have received a greatly increased amount of tanks and armored vehicles as well as aircraft, in comparison with the last major shipment." 
 soviet.84.a:0 "Right on time."
 
 soviet.85.t:0 "Fourth Delivery"
 soviet.85.d:0 "Our western allies continue to supplement our production. While this arrangement will be coming to an end very soon, it undoubtedly provided significant assistance to us in our fight against fascism." 
 soviet.85.a:0 "Keep it up."
 
 soviet.86.t:0 "Final Delivery"
 soviet.86.d:0 "Today we have received our last major lend-lease shipment from the western democracies. Unfortunately they tell us that they can help us no longer. On the bright side, what most of the equipment we currently have in service will eventually wear down and be scrapped before the end of the war, erasing our debt to the Americans under the terms of lend-lease."
 soviet.86.a:0 "Too bad."
 
 soviet.87.t:0 "The Fall of Moscow"
 soviet.87.d:0 "Unfortunately we have lost Moscow. We have prepared for this eventuality and have moved our capital to Kuybyshev, which will hopefully be out of the range of the current enemy offense." 
 soviet.87.a:0 "We must relocate our capital!"
 
 soviet.88.t:0 "Moscow Recaptured"
 soviet.88.d:0 "We have recovered Moscow, we shall begin transfering our staff and equipment back. Hopefully we will not lose her again." 
 soviet.88.a:0 "We can move our capital back now."
 
 soviet.89.t:0 "The Great Patriotic War"
 soviet.89.d:0 "German treachery will not go unanswered. The Motherland has assembled fresh manpower reserves to send to the fight. The Nazis cannot win in the face of such overwhelming oppositions. Our men will all fight and die as heroes until the Nazi scum have no more fodder to send to our butchery." 
 soviet.89.a:0 "We will fight until the last drop of blood."
 
 soviet.90.t:0 "Continuation of the Great Patriotic War"
 soviet.90.d:0 "The memory of the German betrayal will stay with us always. We will never forget those who perished because of tolerance for fascism that existed throughout the world at one time." 
 soviet.90.a:0 "We will never forget dirty Hitlerite treachery."
 
 
 soviet.91.t:0 "The Soviet Union Tests Detonation of a Plutonium Bomb"
 soviet.91.d:0 "The Soviet Union has reminded the world of their progress in nuclear research. Their arsenal of atom bombs is enough of a deterent to prevent any enemy from waging war on them unscathed."
 soviet.91.a:0 "Obviously, we have entered an era of mututally assured destruction. We cannot afford to go to war."
 soviet.91.b:0 "What dangerous times we live in."
 
 soviet.93.t:0 "The Soviet Union Tests Detonation of an Atomic Weapon"
 soviet.93.d:0 "The Soviet Union has proven to the world the success of their atom bomb project, by successfully detonating 'First Lightning' (Pervaya molniya or Joe-1) at Semipalatinsk Test Site, Kazakahstan."
 soviet.93.a:0 "Obviously, we have entered an era of mututally assured destruction. We cannot afford to go to war."
 soviet.93.b:0 "What dangerous times we live in."
 soviet.93.c:0 "Hopefully this will make us safer."
 
 soviet.94.t:0 "The United States Annouces Non-Aggression Towards the Soviet Union"
 soviet.94.d:0 "The Americans have made it very clear through private channels that they wish for our two countries to co-exist peacefully and have stressed that to fail to do so might possibly result in the destruction of the human race."
 soviet.94.a:0 "Perhaps we were able to achieve 'Peace in Our Time'?"
 
 
 soviet.92.t:0 "First Election of the Soviet Union"
 soviet.92.d:0 "Today the Soviet Union hosted her first democratic election. The results were unsurprising to those pessimistic of the new development - Joseph Stalin won by a healthy margin, with 74% of the vote. The question many are asking is: 'has anything really changed in the Soviet Union?' Only time will tell." 
 soviet.92.a:0 "Doesn't quite seem like freedom."
